# Cannon Chaos

## Overview  
**Cannon Chaos** is a **real-time online multiplayer game** where players compete in a grid-based arena, racing to control powerful cannons and eliminate opponents. The last player standing wins.  

The game follows a **client-server architecture**, where one player hosts the server, and all others connect as clients. Networking is implemented using **raw socket programming**, ensuring direct communication between players.  

## Gameplay Mechanics  

- The game takes place on a **square grid-based arena** with obstacles providing cover.  
- **Cannons spawn randomly** on the map, and players must race to reach them.  
- The first player to **reach a cannon gains exclusive control** (mutex lock).  
- Cannons have a **timed duration of use**‚Äîif the player doesn't fire within the time limit, they **explode**.  
- Each cannon has a **limited number of shots** before becoming inactive.  

### üî• Cannon Types  
- **Rapid Shot** ‚Äì Fires fast but deals low damage.  
- **Explosive Shell** ‚Äì Slow but has a large explosion radius.  
- **Bouncing Shot** ‚Äì Ricochets off walls, hitting unexpected angles.  

### üéØ Player Abilities  
- Players must **dodge, hide, and strategize** to avoid being shot.  
- **Dash ability** allows quick movement (short cooldown).  
- **Health bar** decreases when hit; players are eliminated when it reaches zero.  
- If two players try to grab the same cannon, a **quick reaction mini-game** (e.g., button mash) determines the winner.  

### ‚ö° Game Flow Enhancements  
- **Power-ups** drop when a player is eliminated (e.g., speed boost, health pack).  
- **Sudden Death Mode** activates if the match lasts too long (faster cannon fire, shrinking map).  

## Winning Condition  
- The **last player alive wins the round**.  

## Technical Details  

- **Client-Server Model**  
  - One player starts the **server**, and all players (including the host) connect as **clients**.  
- **No External Game Networking Libraries**  
  - The backend is written using **raw socket programming** for player movement, cannon control, and game state synchronization.  
- **Simple 2D Graphics**  
  - The game uses **Pygame** for rendering, focusing on functionality over complexity.  

## Installation & Setup  
### Prerequisites  
- Python 3.x  
- Pygame (`pip install pygame`)  

### Running the Game  
1. Start the server:  
   ```sh
   python server.py

   ## Task Distribution  

The project is developed by a **4-person team**, with each member focusing on a specific aspect of the game.  

### üñ•Ô∏è Backend (Client-Server Communication) ‚Äì **Developer 1**  
- Implement **server logic** using raw Python sockets.  
- Handle **message passing** between clients (player positions, cannon control, health updates).  
- Use **multithreading** or **asyncio** to support multiple players.  

### üéÆ Game Logic & Mechanics ‚Äì **Developer 2**  
- Implement **player movement, cannon mechanics, and health tracking**.  
- Handle **collision detection** for cannon hits.  
- Manage the **game loop and event handling**.  

### üñºÔ∏è Frontend (Graphics & UI) ‚Äì **Developer 3**  
- Implement **player sprites, map rendering, and UI elements** (health bar, timer, etc.).  
- Display **cannon aiming and shooting animations**.  
- Ensure smooth **user input handling** (mouse and keyboard).  

### üì° Networking Integration ‚Äì **Developer 4**  
- Connect **frontend to backend** (send and receive player actions).  
- Optimize **message sending** to reduce latency and improve synchronization.  
- Handle **game state updates** to ensure all players see consistent gameplay.  

## Development Timeline  

| Week  | Task |
|-------|------|
| **Week 1** | Set up **socket-based server**, basic **Pygame UI**, and **game loop**. |
| **Week 2** | Implement **cannon locking, shooting mechanics, health tracking**. |
| **Week 3** | Finalize **networking, smooth movement, and latency optimization**. |
