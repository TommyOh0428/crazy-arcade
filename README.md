# Cannon Chaos

## Overview  
**Cannon Chaos** is a **real-time online multiplayer game** where players compete in a grid-based arena, racing to control powerful cannons and eliminate opponents. The last player standing wins.  

The game follows a **client-server architecture**, where one player hosts the server, and all others connect as clients. Networking is implemented using **raw socket programming**, ensuring direct communication between players.  

## Gameplay Mechanics  

- The game takes place on a **square grid-based arena** with obstacles providing cover.  
- **Cannons spawn randomly** on the map, and players must race to reach them.  
- The first player to **reach a cannon gains exclusive control** (mutex lock).  
- Cannons have a **timed duration of use**â€”if the player doesn't fire within the time limit, they **explode**.  
- Each cannon has a **limited number of shots** before becoming inactive.  

### ðŸ”¥ Cannon Types  
- **Rapid Shot** â€“ Fires fast but deals low damage.  
- **Explosive Shell** â€“ Slow but has a large explosion radius.  
- **Bouncing Shot** â€“ Ricochets off walls, hitting unexpected angles.  

### ðŸŽ¯ Player Abilities  
- Players must **dodge, hide, and strategize** to avoid being shot.  
- **Dash ability** allows quick movement (short cooldown).  
- **Health bar** decreases when hit; players are eliminated when it reaches zero.  
- If two players try to grab the same cannon, a **quick reaction mini-game** (e.g., button mash) determines the winner.  

### âš¡ Game Flow Enhancements  
- **Power-ups** drop when a player is eliminated (e.g., speed boost, health pack).  
- **Sudden Death Mode** activates if the match lasts too long (faster cannon fire, shrinking map).  

## Winning Condition  
- The **last player alive wins the round**.  

## Technical Details  

- **Client-Server Model**  
  - One player starts the **server**, and all players (including the host) connect as **clients**.  
- **No External Game Networking Libraries**  
  - The backend is written using **raw socket programming** for player movement, cannon control, and game state synchronization.  
- **Simple 2D Graphics**  
  - The game uses **Pygame** for rendering, focusing on functionality over complexity.  

## Installation & Setup  
### Prerequisites  
- Python 3.x  
- Pygame (`pip install pygame`)  

### Running the Game  
1. Start the server:  
   ```sh
   python server.py
